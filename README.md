Using a monothetic clustering algorithm for grouping similar sentences
=========================

NLP Final project

The goal of this project is to use a text collection, process the raw text using WordSeer's back end processing 
pipeline and then cluster similar sentences using a monothetic clustering technique such as the DisCover Algorithm [1].
The idea is to use NLP techniques to identify shared words between sentences to cluster similar sentences. 
After eliminating the bad clusters, we would visualise the clusters and find some interesting patterns in them. We
would like to focus only on good clusters for further analysis.
